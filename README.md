# ![pack.png](https://github.com/DiabolicalGolem/Better-Drops-Fabric/blob/main/src/main/resources/pack.png) Better Drops \(Fabric\)

*Adding drops to the dropless.*


## About

This is the "Better Drops" Fabric Mod. The author was tired of seeing so many mobs added that have no purpose to the overall game, so the aim is to simply add drops to the mobs that have no drops!

## Installing

Because this is in a very Alpha stage, there is currently no easy way to install it. Until the mod enters its Beta, you will have to do the heavy lifting in installing the mod: the author will not make a .jar file.

It is recommended to install Appleskin mod along side.
